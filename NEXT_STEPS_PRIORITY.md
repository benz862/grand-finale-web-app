## 🎯 **NEXT PRIORITY STEPS**

### **STEP 1: Verify Personal Information Database Sync** 
**Status**: 🟡 Recently Fixed - Needs Testing
**Files**: `PERSONAL_INFO_SYNC_FIXED.md`, `src/lib/databaseSync.ts`

**What to do:**
1. Test the comprehensive personal info form with a real user
2. Verify ALL 40+ fields are saving (not just basic 7)
3. Confirm Pat Donnelly-type scenarios work properly

**Why this matters:** This was your original issue - users' detailed personal information (birthday, pronouns, government IDs, family info) not being saved to database.

---

### **STEP 2: Authentication & Login Issues**
**Status**: 🟡 Partially Fixed - Email Verification Bypass
**Files**: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

**What to do:**
1. Test login functionality with real users
2. Verify email verification bypass is working
3. Ensure users can access their accounts properly

**Why this matters:** Users need to be able to login to access their saved data and submit requests.

### **STEP 3: Complete Name Change Data Integration**
**Status**: 🟠 Next Enhancement
**What to do:**
1. Apply approved name changes to `personal_info` table
2. Test complete workflow: Request → Approve → Update User Data
3. Verify data consistency after name changes

**Why this matters:** Complete the name change workflow by actually updating user's personal information.

### **STEP 4: Production Deployment Readiness**
**Status**: 🔴 Not Started
**Files**: `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`, `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**What to do:**
1. Review deployment documentation
2. Test production environment setup
3. Verify all systems work in production
