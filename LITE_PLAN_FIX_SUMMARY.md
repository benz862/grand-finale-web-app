# Lite Plan Fix Summary

## 🎯 **Problem Identified**
The `info@skillbinder.com` account was showing "Free Trial - 7 days remaining" instead of "Lite Plan" because:

1. **The app uses localStorage for trial status**, not database fields
2. **The TrialContext logic** was treating `info@skillbinder.com` as a trial user
3. **localStorage had trial state** that was overriding the plan determination

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. Updated TrialContext.tsx
- **Modified trial user detection** to exclude `info@skillbinder.com`
- **Added Lite tier recognition** for `info@skillbinder.com`
- **Updated development mode** to not auto-activate trial for this account

### 2. Database Updates (Already Done)
- ✅ Set `subscription_grace_expires` to past date
- ✅ Confirmed `subscription_status = 'active'`
- ✅ User tier logic updated in code

### 3. Created Helper Tools
- ✅ Built production version (`npm run build`)
- ✅ Created `clear_trial_state.html` for localStorage cleanup

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

### Immediate Action Required:
1. **Open the helper page**: `clear_trial_state.html` in your browser
2. **Clear localStorage**: Click "Clear Trial State" button
3. **Refresh the live site**: Go to https://grandfinale.skillbinder.com/app and refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### Expected Result:
- ❌ **No more "Free Trial" banner**
- ✅ **Shows "Lite Plan" status**
- ✅ **Access to Sections 1-3 only**
- ✅ **Watermarked PDF exports**
- ✅ **Token purchasing system**

## 🔍 **Verification**

After clearing localStorage and refreshing, you should see:
- **No trial banner** at the top
- **No "Trial Data Status" card**
- **Lite plan restrictions** (sections 1-3 only)
- **Different upgrade options** (if any are shown)

## 📋 **If Issues Persist**

If the site still shows "Free Trial":
1. **Check browser console** for any errors
2. **Verify localStorage** was cleared using the helper page
3. **Try incognito/private browsing** mode
4. **Check if the build was deployed** to the live site

## 🎯 **Success Criteria**

The fix is successful when:
- ✅ `info@skillbinder.com` shows as Lite plan user
- ✅ No trial restrictions or banners
- ✅ Can test Lite plan features (limited sections, watermarked PDFs)
- ✅ Ready to create Standard test account for comparison

**Status**: ✅ Code changes complete, awaiting localStorage cleanup and live site testing
