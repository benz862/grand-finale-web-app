## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

### **QR Code Data Structure**
```javascript
{
  fileUrl: "https://...", // Direct link to file
  fileName: "test-document.pdf",
  fileType: "document",
  description: "Important document",
  uploadDate: "2025-01-27T..."
}
```

### **Database Schema**
The system works with your existing `file_uploads` table:
- `file_name`: Display name
- `original_file_name`: Original filename
- `file_type`: video/voice/document/reference
- `file_category`: Category name
- `file_url`: Supabase storage URL
- `qr_code_url`: Generated QR code data URL
- `qr_code_data`: JSON metadata for QR code
- `description`: User description

### **PDF Integration**
- QR codes are embedded as images in PDF
- Each file gets its own QR code
- QR codes are positioned next to file information
- Fallback text if QR code image fails to load

## ðŸŽ‰ **Expected Results**

1. **File Upload**: âœ… Files upload successfully with QR codes
2. **Database**: âœ… File metadata saved to existing tables
3. **PDF Generation**: âœ… PDF includes QR codes for each file
4. **QR Scanning**: âœ… QR codes link directly to uploaded files
5. **Mobile Access**: âœ… Any phone can scan and access files

## ðŸš€ **Ready for Production**

The system is now fully functional and ready for users to:
- Upload important files (videos, documents, voice recordings)
- Generate QR codes automatically
- Include QR codes in legacy planning PDFs
- Allow loved ones to access files by scanning QR codes

This creates a seamless bridge between physical documents (PDF) and digital files (accessible via QR codes).
