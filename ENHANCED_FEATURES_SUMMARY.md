## Technical Implementation Details

### File Storage Structure:
```
Supabase Storage:
├── name-change-documents/
│   └── {userId}/
│       └── {requestId}_{timestamp}.{ext}
└── feedback-attachments/
    └── {userId}/
        └── {feedbackId}_{timestamp}.{ext}
```

### Database Relationships:
- `file_uploads` → `name_change_requests` (via request_id)
- `file_uploads` → `feedback_submissions` (via feedback_id)
- Both systems maintain proper foreign key relationships and RLS policies

### Security Features:
1. **Row Level Security**: Users can only access their own files
2. **File Validation**: Size and type restrictions prevent abuse
3. **Secure URLs**: Supabase handles secure file access
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all file operations

### Next Steps:
1. **Run the Database Migration**: Execute `enhanced_name_change_with_uploads.sql`
2. **Create Storage Buckets**: Set up the required Supabase Storage buckets
3. **Configure Storage Policies**: Apply the storage access policies
4. **Test File Uploads**: Verify upload functionality works correctly
5. **Admin Dashboard**: Consider building admin tools for managing feedback

This implementation provides a professional, secure, and user-friendly system for both document verification and product improvement feedback, while creating a positive feedback loop that benefits both users and the business.
