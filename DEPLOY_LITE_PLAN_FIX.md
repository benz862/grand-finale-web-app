# 🚀 Deploy Lite Plan Fix to Live Site

## 🎯 **Current Status**
- ✅ **Code changes complete** - `TrialContext.tsx` updated to recognize `info@skillbinder.com` as Lite user
- ✅ **Build successful** - `npm run build` completed, `dist/` folder ready
- ✅ **localStorage cleared** - Trial state removed from browser
- ❌ **Live site still shows "Free Trial"** - Code changes not deployed yet

## 🚀 **Deployment Options**

### Option 1: Vercel (Most Likely)
If the site is deployed on Vercel:

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy from project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd "The Grand Finale Web App - Famous"
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Follow prompts** to link to existing project or create new

### Option 2: Netlify
If the site is deployed on Netlify:

1. **Install Netlify CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g netlify-cli
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   cd "The Grand Finale Web App - Famous"
   netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
   ```

### Option 3: Manual Upload
If using a different platform:

1. **Upload the `dist/` folder contents** to your hosting platform
2. **Ensure all files are uploaded** including:
   - `index.html`
   - `assets/` folder
   - All static files

### Option 4: Git-based Deployment
If the site auto-deploys from Git:

1. **Commit and push changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Recognize info@skillbinder.com as Lite user"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Wait for auto-deployment** to complete

## 🔍 **How to Determine Deployment Platform**

### Check for Deployment Files:
```bash
# Look for deployment configuration files
ls -la | grep -E "(vercel|netlify|railway|heroku)"
```

### Check Git Remote:
```bash
# Check if connected to deployment platform
git remote -v
```

### Check Package.json Scripts:
```bash
# Look for deployment scripts
cat package.json | grep -A 10 -B 5 "scripts"
```

## 🎯 **Verification Steps**

After deployment:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** for deployment to complete
2. **Clear browser cache** completely (Ctrl+Shift+Delete)
3. **Visit** https://grandfinale.skillbinder.com/app
4. **Login** with `info@skillbinder.com`
5. **Check for changes**:
   - ❌ No "Free Trial" banner
   - ✅ Shows "Lite Plan" or similar
   - ✅ No trial restrictions

## 🚨 **If Deployment Fails**

### Common Issues:
1. **Authentication required** - Need login credentials for deployment platform
2. **Environment variables** - May need to set up production environment
3. **Build errors** - Check for any TypeScript or build issues

### Fallback Options:
1. **Contact hosting provider** for deployment assistance
2. **Use development server** for testing (localhost:8080)
3. **Create new deployment** if current one is inaccessible

## 📋 **Success Criteria**

The deployment is successful when:
- ✅ Live site shows `info@skillbinder.com` as Lite user
- ✅ No trial banners or restrictions
- ✅ Can test Lite plan features (sections 1-3, watermarked PDFs)
- ✅ Ready to create Standard test account

**Next Action**: Determine deployment platform and deploy the updated code
