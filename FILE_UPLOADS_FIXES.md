# File Uploads & Multimedia Memories - Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Row-Level Security (RLS) Error
**Problem**: Users were getting "new row violates row-level security policy" error when trying to upload files.

**Solution**: 
- Created `fix_file_uploads_storage.sql` script to properly set up:
  - Storage bucket `legacy-files` with proper file type restrictions
  - RLS policies for both the `file_uploads_multimedia` table and storage objects
  - Proper permissions for authenticated users

### 2. PDF Generation for File Uploads
**Problem**: The PDF generation wasn't properly configured for file uploads section.

**Solution**:
- Updated `PDFData` interface to include `'fileUploads'` form type
- Created `addFileUploadsContent` function in `pdfGenerator.ts` that:
  - Generates QR codes for each uploaded file using the `qrcode` library
  - Groups files by category
  - Displays QR codes with file information (Display Name, File Type, Description)
  - Uses SkillBinder blue color (#17394B) for QR codes
  - Handles errors gracefully with fallback text display
- Updated `FileUploadsMultimediaForm.tsx` to use correct `formType: 'fileUploads'`

## How to Apply the Fixes

### 1. Run the SQL Script
Execute the `fix_file_uploads_storage.sql` script in your Supabase SQL editor to:
- Create the storage bucket
- Set up RLS policies
- Grant proper permissions

### 2. Deploy the Code Changes
The following files have been updated:
- `src/lib/pdfGenerator.ts` - Added file uploads PDF generation
- `src/components/FileUploadsMultimediaForm.tsx` - Updated PDF generation call

## PDF Features

The File Uploads PDF will now include:
- **QR Codes**: Each uploaded file gets a QR code that links to the file URL
- **File Information**: Display Name, File Type, Description, Upload Date
- **Categorized Display**: Files are grouped by their category
- **Professional Layout**: Uses SkillBinder branding colors and proper spacing

## QR Code Details

- **Size**: 25mm x 25mm in the PDF
- **Colors**: SkillBinder blue (#17394B) on white background
- **Content**: **Direct file URL** - when scanned, immediately opens the file
- **Positioning**: Left side with file information to the right

### How QR Codes Work

1. **User uploads file** → File gets stored in Supabase Storage with public URL
2. **QR code generated** → Contains the direct file URL (e.g., `https://your-project.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/legacy-files/uploads/user123/file.jpg`)
3. **PDF printed** → QR code appears in the PDF
4. **Phone scans QR code** → Immediately opens the file URL
5. **File opens** → Image displays, video plays, or document downloads

### File Types Supported
- **Images**: .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .gif (display in browser)
- **Videos**: .mp4, .mov, .avi (play in browser or app)
- **Documents**: .pdf, .docx, .txt (download or open in app)
- **Audio**: .mp3, .wav, .m4a (play in browser or app)

## Error Handling

- If QR code generation fails, the PDF falls back to text-only display
- If no files are uploaded, shows "No files have been uploaded yet" message
- Graceful handling of missing file data

## Testing

After applying the fixes:
1. Try uploading a file in Section 16
2. Generate a PDF to verify QR codes appear correctly
3. Test QR code scanning to ensure it links to the uploaded file
