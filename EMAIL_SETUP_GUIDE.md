# Email Notification Setup Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you set up automatic email notifications for support requests. When a user submits a support form, you'll automatically receive an email at `support@skillbinder.com` with all the request details.

## üöÄ Quick Setup (Development)

### Option 1: Simple Console Logging (Current)
The system is currently set up to log email content to the console. This is perfect for development and testing.

**What happens:**
- Support requests are saved to the database
- Email content is logged to the browser console
- You can see the full email content in the developer tools

**To view the emails:**
1. Open your browser's Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Submit a support request
4. Look for the "=== SUPPORT REQUEST EMAIL ===" log

## üìß Production Email Setup

### Option 2: SendGrid (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Create SendGrid Account
1. Go to [SendGrid.com](https://sendgrid.com)
2. Sign up for a free account (100 emails/day free)
3. Verify your email address

#### Step 2: Get API Key
1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
2. Click "Create API Key"
3. Choose "Full Access" or "Restricted Access" with "Mail Send" permissions
4. Copy the API key

#### Step 3: Verify Your Domain
1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to Settings ‚Üí Sender Authentication
2. Choose "Domain Authentication" (recommended) or "Single Sender Verification"
3. Follow the setup instructions for your domain

#### Step 4: Install SendGrid Package
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

#### Step 5: Set Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_sendgrid_api_key_here
```

#### Step 6: Deploy the Email Function
1. Copy `api/send-support-email-sendgrid.js` to `api/send-support-email.js`
2. Deploy to your hosting platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

### Option 3: Other Email Services

#### Mailgun
```bash
npm install mailgun.js
```

#### AWS SES
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-ses
```

#### Nodemailer (Gmail)
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

## üìã Email Content Format

The emails you'll receive will include:

**Subject:** `The Grand Finale - Support Request`

**Body includes:**
- Request ID (for tracking)
- User information (name, email, user ID)
- Request details (subject, category, message)
- Submission timestamp
- Professional HTML formatting with SkillBinder branding

## üîß Configuration Options

### Customize Email Template
Edit the HTML template in `api/send-support-email-sendgrid.js` to match your branding.

### Add CC/BCC Recipients
Modify the email function to add additional recipients:

```javascript
const msg = {
  to: 'support@skillbinder.com',
  cc: 'admin@skillbinder.com', // Add CC
  bcc: 'backup@skillbinder.com', // Add BCC
  // ... rest of email config
};
```

### Email Filtering
Add filtering based on request category:

```javascript
// Send urgent requests to different email
if (supportData.category === 'urgent') {
  msg.to = 'urgent-support@skillbinder.com';
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending
1. Check your API key is correct
2. Verify your domain is authenticated in SendGrid
3. Check the browser console for error messages
4. Verify your hosting platform supports serverless functions

### Emails Going to Spam
1. Set up proper SPF/DKIM records
2. Use a verified sender domain
3. Avoid spam trigger words in subject lines
4. Warm up your email sending reputation

### Development Testing
1. Use the console logging version for testing
2. Check browser network tab for API calls
3. Verify the email function is being called
4. Test with different request categories

## üìä Monitoring

### SendGrid Dashboard
- Track email delivery rates
- Monitor bounce rates
- View open/click rates
- Set up alerts for failures

### Custom Logging
Add custom logging to track email success:

```javascript
// In your email function
console.log(`Email sent to ${to} for request ${supportData.id}`);
```

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **API Key Protection**: Never expose API keys in client-side code
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
3. **Input Validation**: Validate all email inputs
4. **Spam Protection**: Implement CAPTCHA or other anti-spam measures

## üìû Support

If you need help setting up the email system:
1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify your SendGrid account setup
3. Test with the console logging version first
4. Contact your hosting provider for serverless function support

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Choose your email provider** (SendGrid recommended)
2. **Set up your account** and get API keys
3. **Deploy the email function** to your hosting platform
4. **Test the system** with a support request
5. **Monitor email delivery** and adjust as needed

The email system is now fully integrated with your support form and will automatically notify you whenever someone submits a support request!
