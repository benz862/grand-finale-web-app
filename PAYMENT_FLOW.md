# Payment Flow Documentation

## Overview

The Grand Finale app implements a complete payment flow that integrates with Stripe for secure payment processing. Here's how the system works:

## User Flow

1. **External Link** → User clicks your custom link to pricing page
2. **Pricing Page** → User selects a plan and clicks "Subscribe"
3. **Payment Portal** → User enters email and completes payment
4. **Payment Processing** → Stripe processes the payment securely
5. **Account Creation** → System creates user account automatically
6. **Welcome Email** → User receives email with login credentials
7. **Login Access** → User can log in and access the full app

## Components

### 1. Pricing Page (`/pricing`)
- Displays all available plans
- Links to payment portal with plan ID
- URL: `https://yourapp.com/pricing`

### 2. Payment Portal (`/payment?plan=plan_id`)
- Secure payment form
- Stripe integration
- Email collection
- Plan confirmation

### 3. Email Service
- Sends welcome emails with login credentials
- Professional HTML templates
- Plan details included

## Integration Points

### For External Links

Create links like:
```
https://yourapp.com/pricing
https://yourapp.com/payment?plan=lifetime
https://yourapp.com/payment?plan=standard_monthly
```

### Available Plan IDs

- `lite_monthly` - $4/month
- `standard_monthly` - $8/month  
- `premium_monthly` - $12/month
- `lifetime` - $199 one-time
- `lite_yearly` - $40/year
- `standard_yearly` - $80/year
- `premium_yearly` - $120/year

## Backend API Requirements

To make this production-ready, you'll need these API endpoints:

### 1. Payment Processing
```
POST /api/stripe/create-payment-intent
POST /api/stripe/create-checkout-session
GET /api/stripe/verify-payment
```

### 2. User Management
```
POST /api/create-user-account
POST /api/send-welcome-email
```

### 3. Email Service
```
POST /api/send-welcome-email
```

## Stripe Integration

### Required Stripe Features
- Payment Intents API
- Checkout Sessions
- Webhooks for payment confirmation
- Customer management

### Environment Variables
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

## Email Service Options

### Recommended Services
1. **SendGrid** - Professional email delivery
2. **Mailgun** - Developer-friendly
3. **AWS SES** - Cost-effective for high volume

### Email Template
The system includes a professional HTML email template with:
- Welcome message
- Plan details
- Login instructions
- Support information

## Security Considerations

1. **HTTPS Required** - All payment pages must use HTTPS
2. **Stripe Security** - Never handle raw card data
3. **Email Validation** - Verify email addresses
4. **Rate Limiting** - Prevent abuse
5. **Fraud Detection** - Implement basic fraud checks

## Demo Mode

The current implementation includes a demo mode that:
- Simulates payment processing
- Creates test accounts
- Sends demo emails
- Perfect for development and testing
