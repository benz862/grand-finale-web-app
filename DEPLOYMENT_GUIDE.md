# File Upload System Deployment Guide

## ‚úÖ Completed Steps

1. **Database Migration** - You've run `enhanced_name_change_with_uploads.sql`
   - Created `file_uploads` table
   - Created `feedback_submissions` table  
   - Added RLS policies
   - Created indexes and triggers

## üöÄ Next Steps to Deploy

### Step 1: Create Storage Buckets

Run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard:

```bash
# In Supabase Dashboard > SQL Editor, run:
```

**File:** `setup_storage_buckets.sql`

This will:
- Create two storage buckets: `name-change-documents` and `feedback-attachments`
- Set 10MB file size limits
- Configure allowed file types
- Set up security policies

### Step 2: Verify Bucket Creation

After running the storage setup script, verify in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to **Storage** section
2. Check that these buckets exist:
   - `name-change-documents` (Private)
   - `feedback-attachments` (Private)
3. Verify policies are in place under **Policies** tab

### Step 3: Test File Upload Functionality

Use the test component to verify everything works:

1. Add the test component to your app temporarily:
   ```tsx
   import { FileUploadTest } from '@/components/FileUploadTest';
   
   // Add to any page for testing
   <FileUploadTest />
   ```

2. Run tests to verify:
   - File validation works
   - Uploads succeed to both buckets
   - Files are properly saved to database
   - File deletion works
   - User permissions are enforced

### Step 4: Integration Points

The new features are already integrated:

1. **Name Change Requests** - Users can now upload supporting documents
2. **Feedback Form** - Available in the Conclusion section with reward tracking
3. **File Management** - Complete upload, view, and delete functionality

### Step 5: Admin Dashboard (Optional)

Consider building an admin interface to:
- Review feedback submissions
- Mark suggestions as implemented
- Grant rewards (2 months free service)
- Manage uploaded documents

## üîß Technical Details

### File Limits
- **Max Size:** 10MB per file
- **Types:** PDF, Word docs, images, videos, audio, text files
- **Storage:** Secure private buckets with user-specific folders

### Security Features
- Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- User-specific file access only
- Secure file paths with user ID prefixes
- Input validation and sanitization

### Database Tables Added
- `file_uploads` - Stores file metadata and relationships
- `feedback_submissions` - Tracks user suggestions and rewards

## üéØ Business Features Delivered

1. **Document Upload for Name Changes**
   - Users can upload supporting documents
   - Helps with vetting process
   - Secure file storage

2. **Feedback System with Rewards**
   - Structured feedback collection
   - Category-based organization
   - 2-month free service rewards for implemented ideas
   - Admin tracking and management

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- All files are private by default
- Users can only access their own files
- File type validation prevents malicious uploads
- Size limits prevent storage abuse
- Database triggers maintain data consistency

## üìã Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- File upload success rates
- Storage usage
- Feedback submission volume
- User engagement with new features

**Ready to deploy!** Just run the storage setup script and test the functionality.
