## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 16.0 or later
- iPhone/iPad with camera

### Installation
1. Clone or download the project files
2. Open the project in Xcode
3. Configure your development team and bundle identifier
4. Build and run on device (camera features require physical device)

### Permissions
The app requires the following permissions (automatically handled in Info.plist):
- Camera access for video recording
- Microphone access for audio recording
- Photo library access for saving videos

## Usage Guide

### Basic Operation
1. **Launch App**: Opens to main teleprompter view
2. **Load Script**: Use Scripts tab to create or edit content
3. **Start Recording**: Tap red record button to begin video capture
4. **Begin Teleprompter**: Tap play button to start text scrolling
5. **Control Speed**: Use slider to adjust scroll speed in real-time
6. **Manual Control**: Touch and drag to manually position text

### AI Script Generation
1. Navigate to Scripts tab
2. Tap "AI Script Assistant" to expand
3. Enter keywords separated by commas
4. Choose style: Formal, Casual, or News
5. Generated script appears in editor
6. Edit as needed and load to teleprompter

### Video Recording Tips
- Use landscape orientation for better framing
- Ensure good lighting on your face
- Position camera at eye level
- Test audio levels before important recordings
- Use front camera for direct eye contact

## Advanced Features

### Gradient Text Effect
The app implements a sophisticated gradient mask that creates the professional teleprompter fade effect:
- Bottom 25%: Completely transparent
- Middle 50%: Gradual fade from transparent to opaque
- Top 25%: Fully opaque before scrolling off screen

### Professional Controls
- **Speed Control**: Real-time adjustment from 0.1x to 5.0x
- **Font Scaling**: 16pt to 72pt with live preview
- **Color Customization**: Full color picker for text
- **Opacity Control**: Fine-tune text visibility

### Script Templates
The AI system includes three distinct writing styles:
- **Formal**: Professional presentation style
- **Casual**: YouTuber/vlogger friendly tone
- **News**: Broadcast journalism format

## Customization

### Extending AI Features
To add new script styles, modify the `ScriptGenerator` class:

```swift
private func generateCustomScript(keywords: [String]) -> String {
    // Implement your custom generation logic
    return customScript
}
```

### UI Modifications
The SwiftUI architecture makes it easy to customize:
- Modify colors in theme files
- Adjust layouts in view files
- Add new control options in SettingsView

### Video Settings
Customize recording parameters in `CameraManager`:
- Video quality presets
- Frame rate options
- Compression settings

## Performance Optimization

- Efficient memory usage with lazy loading
- Optimized scroll rendering with minimal redraws
- Background thread processing for AI generation
- Smart caching for improved responsiveness

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Camera not working**: Ensure app has camera permissions
2. **Poor video quality**: Check video settings in Settings tab
3. **Text not visible**: Adjust opacity and color settings
4. **Slow scrolling**: Reduce font size or simplify text formatting

### Performance Tips
- Close other apps to free memory
- Use newer devices for 4K recording
- Keep scripts under 10,000 words for best performance
- Restart app if experiencing issues

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Cloud sync for scripts across devices
- Advanced AI with GPT integration
- External monitor support
- Multi-language script generation
- Team collaboration features
- Professional teleprompter hardware integration

### Contributing
